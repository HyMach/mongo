# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! We welcome contributions large and small, from documentation to code. Following these guidelines helps communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, we will recriprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

There are many ways to contribute, from advocy through writing tutorials or blog posts, improving or translating the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into future Marrow Mongo releases.

Unsure of where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through the [Help Wanted](https://github.com/marrow/mongo/labels/help%20wanted) issues on GitHub. Look for tickets with greater nubmers of reactions and comments to help gauge impact. A good first step is to check out a copy of the code; for details please see the [Installation Instructions](/INSTALLATION.md#development-version).


## Asking Questions

The first step in determining how best to tackle a concern is to ask about it. There are a number of avenues available for discussion and support.

### Freenode IRC

Likely the best way to get fast turnaround on inquiries is through the Marrow Open Source Collective community on Freenode IRC.  Point your IRC client at the [`#webcore`](irc://chat.freenode.net:6667/%23webcore) channel on `chat.freenode.net:6667` (SSL; non-SSL port 6667) or, if you have an IRC client installed which recognizes `irc://` URLs, just click that link.

If you have general Python questions, or general MongoDB questions, [`##python-friendly`](irc://chat.freenode.net:6667/%23%23python-friendly), [`#python`](irc://chat.freenode.net:6667/%23python), or [`#mongodb`](irc://chat.freenode.net:6667/%23mongodb), as appropraite, may be more active. Stack Overflow is also worth considering.


### GitHub Issues

For problems relating to bugs or enhancements witin Marrow Mongo itself, please utilize the [Marrow Mongo Issue Tracker](https://github.com/marrow/mongo/issues) provided by GitHub.  If you have identified an issue and have already begun work on a feature branch, just issue a pull request instead of creating a ticket, then creating a pull request.

Please do not use the issue tracker for general support questions.  IRC, above, or Stack Overflow, below, are better resources for quick questions or longer questions, respectively.

### Stack Overflow

To help develop a comprehensive knowledgebase of problems and solutions, with good metadata, user incentives, and fancy native apps, you can utilize Stack Overflow to ask your questions.  Just remember to tag your question [`marrow.mongo`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/marrow.mongo) so that it can be found.
