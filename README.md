# The Marrow Mongo Document Mapper

Marrow Mongo is a collection of small, focused utilities written to enhance use of the [PyMongo native MongoDB driver](http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/) without the overhead, glacial update cycle, complexity, and head-space requirements of a full *active record* object document mapper.

## Core Features

* **Declarative document modelling.**

* **Refined, Pythonic _data access object_ (DAO) interactions.**

* **Collection and index metadata and creation shortcuts.**

* **Filter construction through rich comparisons.**

* **Parametric filter, projection, sort, and update document construction.**

* **Advanced GeoJSON support.**

* **Liberally licensed under MIT.**

## Code Quality

* **100% test coverage.** Releases are gaurenteed to be fully tested.

* **100% code quality.** Extensive static analysis helps to keep the codebase maintainable.

* **Fantastic documentation.** We'd like to think so, at least!

* **1:1 or greater code to comment ratio.** Code should be self-descriptive and obvious.

* **Extensive roadmap.** Changes to the library are meditated upon before work begins.

Additionally, it provides a very light-weight database connection plugin for the [WebCore web framework](https://github.com/marrow/WebCore) and Python standard logging adapter to emit logs to MongoDB.

This is a living document, evolving as the framework evolves.  You can always browse any point in time within the source repository to review previous versions of these instructions.
