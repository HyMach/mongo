Marrow Mongo is a collection of small, focused utilities written to enhance use of the [PyMongo native MongoDB driver](http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/) without the overhead, glacial update cycle, complexity, and head-space requirements of a full active record object document mapper. Additionally, it provides a very light-weight database connection plugin for the [WebCore web framework](https://github.com/marrow/WebCore) and Python standard logging adapter to emit logs to MongoDB.

This is a living document, evolving as the framework evolves.  You can always browse any point in time within the source repository to review previous versions of these instructions.
